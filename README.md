# CCASSIGNMENT3


This repository contains the files for a Docker-based text processing assignment, including:

- A Dockerfile to build a container that runs a Python script.
- A Python script (` App.py`) that processes two text files (`IF.txt` and `AlwaysRememberUsThisWay.txt`).
- Kubernetes deployment configuration (`k8s-deployment.yaml`) for orchestrating the container with multiple replicas.
- Output files (`result.txt`, `kube_output.txt`) capturing the results of the processing and deployment status.
